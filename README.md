## What is Docker?
Docker is a platform for building, shipping, and running applications in **containers**—isolated environments that include everything needed to run an application. Containers ensure your software behaves the same way in any environment.

## Key Docker Concepts
- **Image**: A lightweight, standalone, executable package that contains all the necessary dependencies and instructions to run software.
- **Container**: A running instance of an image. Containers are isolated and portable.
- **Dockerfile**: A script that defines the steps to build a Docker image.
- **Volumes**: Mechanisms for persisting data generated by and used in Docker containers.
- **Networks**: Enable communication between containers or between containers and external services.

## Why Use Docker?
- **Consistency**: Ensures applications run the same across various environments.
- **Isolation**: Run multiple applications on the same system without conflicts.
- **Portability**: Move applications easily between development, testing, and production environments.
- **Efficiency**: Containers are lightweight and fast to start compared to virtual machines.

## Docker Commands
Here are some commonly used Docker commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `docker pull [image]` | Download an image from Docker Hub. |
| `docker build -t [name] .` | Build an image from a Dockerfile. |
| `docker run [image]` | Run a container from an image. |
| `docker ps` | List running containers. |
| `docker stop [container_id]` | Stop a running container. |
| `docker rm [container_id]` | Remove a container. |
| `docker images` | List all Docker images. |
| `docker exec -it [container_id] bash` | Open a terminal inside a running container. |

## Dockerfile Basics
A Dockerfile is used to build an image. Here’s a simple example:

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js image as the base
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the app's source code
COPY . .

# Expose the app's port
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
